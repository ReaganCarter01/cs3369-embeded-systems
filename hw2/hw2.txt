If you do not have yet, install the command-line tool chains for embedded software development, including two cross-compilers avr-gcc (Linux or Windows) and xc16-gcc (Linux, Windows, or Mac).
Report the following for the two cross-compilers respectively.

a) The version of the two compilers. Use the command like "xxx-gcc --version".

b) The folders where the two compilers are installed. You can use the command like "xxx-gcc -v".

c) The names of the avr-xxx executables and the xc16-xxx executables, for example, avr-gcc, avr-objdump and etc. At least find 5 executables.

d) Compile "hw2.c" with avr-gcc and xc16-gcc and show the screenshots of compilation. The commands are.
   "avr-gcc -o hw2.avr hw2.c -mmcu=atmega128"
   "xc16-gcc -o hw2.pic hw2.c -mcpu=24EP512GU810 -Wl,,--script=p24EP512GU810.gld"

e) Run the two executable "hw2.avr" and "hw2.pic" in your computer and show the screenshots of the execution results.

"hw2.avr.asm" is the AVR assembly dump of the executable built from "hw2.c". Read "hw2.avr.asm" and report the following:

a) Convert all bytes in the .data section, <__data_start>, to ASCII chars.

b) What is the data in the .data section and where is the data in the source code "hw2.c"?

c) Comment each line of the code from line 8c to 96, i.e. the code block <__ctors_end>.

d) Explain what the code block <__ctors_end> does. What is the address of the stack bottom? Hint: IO 0x3e and 0x3d are the stack pointer.

e) Comment each line of the code from line 98 to b0, i.e. the code block <__do_copy_data>.

f) Explain what the code block <__do_copy_data> does. How many bytes of data are copied to which address in the data memory? Hint: elpm is to load one byte from program memory (not data memory) to a register.

g) Comment each line of the code from line e2 to ee.

h) How are the arguments passed to calling the function strncpy? Which registers carry the first argument? Which registers carry the second argument?

i) How is the char array buf[] represented in AVR?

j) Comment each line of the code from line f2 to f6.

k) How is the argument passed to calling the function puts (printf)? Which registers carry the argument?

Gcc defines integer types in stdint.h and bool type in stdbool.h.

a) Report the folders of the two header files in avr-gcc and xc16 respectively. No stdbool.h for avr-gcc.

b) Report the type definitions of int8_t, uint8_t, int16_t, uint16_t, int32_t, uint32_t, int64_t, uint64_t.

c) Report the type definition of bool, and the values of true and false.
